## OOP

This ReactJS Tic-Tac-Toe application makes use of some Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and concepts, even though ReactJS itself is primarily based on a functional programming paradigm. Here's how OOP concepts are applied in the code:

- Encapsulation - Components like Square and Board encapsulate their logic, behavior, and rendering, promoting code modularity and maintainability.
- Abstraction - The calculateWin function abstracts away complex logic for checking win conditions, mirroring the OOP principle of abstraction.

## Features

- Tracks and displays the current player's turn
